# BUSS2022Bodenmiller


This repository contains the R codes necessary to produce the plots in my final report for BUSS 2022 titled Measuring infiltration: Spatial Analysis of Immune Cells in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. This was for a project in Bodenmiller lab under the guidance of Dr. Nicolas Damond and Dr. Ruben Casanova.
